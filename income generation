You may find that you need to raise money to launch your startup. When doing so avoid the following:
Emotional appeals - investors want to know that you have identified a clear problem and you have a solution.
Being vague about what you actually require - investors aren't mind readers. Be explicit.
Present a shopping list of needs - use your research data to substantiate your case.
Making assumptions that the investor knows the problem you are solving. Package your pitch properly.
