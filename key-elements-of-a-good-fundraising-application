Take the following into consideration when preparing your proposal:

A good project - At the heart of it there must be a clear value proposition that connects a problem with a solution. 

Demonstrate the credibility of your business, even if you are a startup. Think creatively about your intellectual assets.

The team - Comb through each person's skills, talents, accolades and the specific value they bring.

Understand the needs of the particular investor, funder, donor or corporation. What do they want to get out of this?
It maybe more than money. Find the thing that makes them tick!
